# roman.py, a Python implementation for integerToNumeral

This is a Python implementation of a coding challenge originally for JavaScript:

```javascript
const numeralMap = {
    "I": 1,
    "V": 5,
    "X": 10,
    "L": 50,
    "C": 100,
    "D": 500,
    "M": 1000
}

/*

The subtractive principle for Roman numbers has these restrictions:

You can only subtract a power of ten, and only from the next two higher "digits", where the digits are {I, V, X, L, C, D, M}.

That is, only I, X and C can be subtracted, AND

I can be subtracted only from V and X; X can be subtracted only from L and C; C can be subtracted only from D and M.

By these rules, the Roman numerals IL for 49 and IC for 99 do not work.

The correct representation for 49 is XLIX, for 99 is XCIX.

integerToNumeral = function(integer) {
    // IMPLEMENT ME

    return null;
}
```
